## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/Unyimesax/team-page/blob/master/screenshot.png)

This project is a team page of a website displaying the names and roles of the creative team.

This page was built with HTML and CSS. You can view the project in realtime on www.my-team-app.netlify.app.
Building this project didn't take me as much time to complete as the previous challenge. I guess I'm getting a hang of this thing.

I had issues pushing changes to an existing repoon github from the command line , I later realized that i had to setup my ssh key .
This challenge is just what i've been looking for.

I can't wait to jump on the next project as I anticipate your honest reviews.
